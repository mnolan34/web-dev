        <p> I cannot rest from travel: I will drink
            Life to the lees: All times I have enjoy'd
            Greatly, have suffer'd greatly, both with those
            That loved me, and alone, on shore, and when
            Thro' scudding drifts the rainy Hyades
            Vext the dim sea: I am become a name
        </p>

        <p>
            O Captain! my Captain! our fearful trip is done,
            The ship has weatherâ€™d every rack, the prize we sought is won,
            The port is near, the bells I hear, the people all exulting,
            While follow eyes the steady keel, the vessel grim and daring;
            But O heart! heart! heart!
            O the bleeding drops of red,
            Where on the deck my Captain lies,
            Fallen cold and dead.
        </p>
